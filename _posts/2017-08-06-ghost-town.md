## ...

I build myself a ghost town
With nothing left but memories
Broken memories shattered to pieces
There's nothing left, nothing left

I look at myself in the mirror
There's a girl staring at me with wild eyes
She's yelling, "Who are you?! Get me out of here!"
There's nothing left, nothing left

I watch her with sad eyes
She's screaming in pain, crying her lungs out
And all I can do is say, "I'm sorry..."
There's nothing left, nothing left

I build myself a ghost town
With nothing left but memories
Trying so hard to ease the pain
There's nothing left, nothing left
