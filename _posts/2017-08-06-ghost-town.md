{% include preloader.html %}

I build myself a ghost town

With nothing left but memories

Broken memories shattered to pieces

There's nothing left, nothing left

&nbsp;

I look at myself in the mirror

There's a girl staring at me with wild eyes

She's yelling, "Who are you?! Get me out of here!"

There's nothing left, nothing left

&nbsp;

I watch her with sad eyes

She's screaming in pain, crying her lungs out

And all I can do is say, "I'm sorry..."

There's nothing left, nothing left

&nbsp;

I build myself a ghost town

With nothing left but memories

Trying so hard to ease the pain

There's nothing left, nothing left

&nbsp;
