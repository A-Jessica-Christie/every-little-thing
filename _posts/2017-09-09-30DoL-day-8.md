They say cigarettes are addictive.

They say alcohols are addictive.

They say drugs are addictive.

&nbsp;

But they never say that YOU are addictive too.

&nbsp;

I should have known...

From the very first moment you walked into my life.

&nbsp;

You make me high, high above the clouds.

I'm addicted to you.. and I just can't get enough.

&nbsp;
