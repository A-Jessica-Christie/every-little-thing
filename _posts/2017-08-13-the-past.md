#### What makes you the person you are today?

&nbsp;

If it was a good thing, cherish it.

Treasure it.

But if it wasn’t, value it.

Give it a meaning.

Because it’s your experience.

Yours.

&nbsp;

The past exists for us not to dwell on it,

but for us to learn from it..

Find the lesson, before you decide to forget about it.

So you won’t fall in the same hole again

So you won’t trip at the same obstacles

So you won’t make the same mistakes all over again

So there will be no more regrets tomorrow…
