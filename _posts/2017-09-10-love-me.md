Don't love me 'cause you think I'm pretty

Don't love me 'cause you think I'm smart

Don't love me 'cause you think I'm cute

Don't love me 'cause you think I'm funny

Don't love me 'cause I'm a romantic

Don't love me 'cause I'm kind

Don't love me 'cause I'm passionate

Don't love me 'cause I'm interesting

&nbsp;

Love me when I got tears on my face

Love me when I don't have the will to go on

Love me when I lost my passion

Love me when I am afraid to hope

Love me when I lost my faith in everything

Love me when I hate myself

Love me when I messed up my life

Love me when I scream my lungs out at night

Love me when I lost myself in madness

Love me when I became the worst version of myself

Love me when I revealed my scars

&nbsp;

Or don't love me at all...

&nbsp;
