Your touch feels warm on my cheek.

So warm that I embrace you and welcome you.

I miss you.

But every time I tried to touch you back, you felt cold.

And when I chose to ignore you, you grew colder.

This is the real love-hate relationship.

Oh you know I don't hate you because you're always there when nobody's there for me.

But I can't say that I love you too because you are the only thing I don't want to be there for me.

I'm just grateful that you make me feel human and you always remind me that I still have feelings.
