Dearest Reader...

&nbsp;

With this little note, I want you to know how grateful I am for this.
Thank you for taking the time to read this little note.
I want to apologise in advance if most of my posts are way too dark and gloomy - it was a really difficult time, and I haven't been writing again for quite some time, so you may say that these posts are rather ancient.
You might also notice the many variations of fonts and layouts, and I apologize again if some of you might find it a little inconvenient. I just want you to really feel and understand all of those writings, and to have a full experience in reading them. Also, for best experience, you can try to read them on laptop/PC.
Lastly, just let me know if you have any stories/posts that you want to be featured here.
Cheers!
