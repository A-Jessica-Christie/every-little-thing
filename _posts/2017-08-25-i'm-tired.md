I'm tired of people and their expectations
I'm tired of the society and their standard of perfection
I'm tired of being helpless and miserable
I'm tired of living hopelessly

Didn't I have enough already?

I don't want the world to change me into something I'm not
I don't want the world to turn me into a bitter person - a more bitter person than I already am
I don't want the world to force me to be someone I hate the most

Please don't let them...

I wanna be the old me
I miss myself
I wanna be that someone you used to call Angel

Let me be your Angel again...
