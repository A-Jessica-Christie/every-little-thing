When everything around you is constantly moving

- just like the earth keeps on revolving around -

and you’re the one who got stuck in the middle,

unmoving, observing everything, and hoping miserably

that nothing will affect you whatsoever,

without knowing that you’re the one who got affected the most,

with silent tears strolling down your face…

&nbsp;
