Aren't you tired of living like this?

Get out of your comfort zone!

Go out and explore the world.

Maybe travel to some exotic or historical places, or just somewhere you really wanna go.

Go out and see the world.

I know there are so many bad things in this world, but don't forget that there are also good things too.

The world has so much to offer.

Open your eyes and see the world as it is. See the good things in everything.

Go and meet total strangers, make new friends.

Go and be amazed by the beauty of the world.

Go and be inspired by some random old souls that you meet in your journey. And maybe one day, you will be an inspiration to someone. Or just have some really good stories to share to your grandkids or family.

Take a risk. Fall in love with someone.

You may get your heart broken again, but so what?

You only live once. Are you just gonna stay inside and "protect" yourself from harm? Go out and experience life!

There are good people out there - good people like yourself.

You just have to find them.

All you have to do is take the first step.

Find your passion, find your happiness.

Live your life to the fullest. Make your life worth living.
