You can't always get what you want in life...

This life and this world, is under no obligation to be fair to you. And you have to accept the fact that there are things that are completely out of your control and you can do nothing about it except to accept it and move on. You can only control how you feel about it and your reaction towards it.

So stop whining like a baby and start grow up and be mature.

There are still other things in your life that are under your control, so man up and create the life you've always wanted.

It'll need a lot of determination and sweats but hey,

you only live once!

Might as well make the best out of it.
