There was a girl locked in a dark room. She was blindfolded, chained to the walls and suffering from unimaginable pain. Her cries for agony were ignored as no one could hear her. She could do nothing but stay there. She begged to God for mercy, but God did not answer.

The Angels who were overseeing the girl sighed and said,

"If only she knew, that the chains were imaginery ― that she could break free with the power of her mind.

If only she knew that she wasn't blindfolded ― that her eyes were shut by herself.

If only she would open her eyes to find the door and escape the walls that she has built around herself..."

Note by Jess:

&nbsp;

I guess at one point in our life, we could relate to the girl in the story...

&nbsp;

We are only limited by our own limitations.

We are only limited by our own weakness.

We are only limited by our own imaginations.
