Beware of your actions. Beware of your words.

Don't you know that words are weapons? You could kill someone with your words.

Well, not literally, no ― thank goodness for that ― but it is a poison that could kill them slowly.

It may mean nothing to you ― your words ― but it may mean everything to them.

Choose your words carefully or you'll break someone's heart...
