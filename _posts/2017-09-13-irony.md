When you were just a baby, your parent taught you to talk and would always encourage you to do it. But when you finally could talk properly, they told you to shut up.

&nbsp;

When you were young, people told you to be perfect ― to strive for perfection, to be a good guy, the nice guy that the world needs. But when you try to become one and getting closer to that, they reject you and say that you're fake.

&nbsp;

When you got older, people told you to learn how to be independent ― to not depend on others. And when you finally become independent, needing nothing but your own, they say that you're a snob ― that you prefer to be alone because you feel too special.

&nbsp;

Lesson in life: fck 'em! Just do what you wanna do.

They will still judge you no matter what. So why don't you just do the things you really wanna do? ― the things you really love. You only live once anyway. Don't waste it doing things that would only make you sick of living.
