When life gets too rough, I tend to run away and hide.

Music, books, games, and movies are my escape.

But no matter how many music I've heard listened to, books I've read, games I've played, and movies I've watched, I just couldn't escape from myself.

There is no escaping these train of thoughts I got inside my brain. Even when I'm asleep, my brain would conjure up images and make me dream of something wild and confusing, and sometimes of things that scare the hell out of me.

I am a prisoner of my mind...

But don't try to save me, 'cause you'd only ended up losing your sanity.
