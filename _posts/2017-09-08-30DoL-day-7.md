#### I am not who you think I am...

You think I'm annoying. You think I'm trouble. You think I'm too much. You think I'm crazy. You think I'm broken. You think I'm just another problem at your door - just another heartache. You think I'm too difficult to handle. But I'll tell you this now. I am not all of those, no. Because I am so much more. Yes. I am far, and way worse than all that.

&nbsp;

#### I'm not someone special, but...

I feel special every time you talk to me, every time you share a tiny little detail about yourself - all those trivial stuff. I feel special every time you show your (concealed) care towards me. I feel special because I got the chance to know you, even just that one side of you. I feel special because you gave me the chance to catch a glimpse of the real you. I feel special because all the little things that you did. It may mean nothing to you, but it means everything to me.

&nbsp;

#### You are the reason...

Because of you I found my passion again.

Because of you I want to get out of this hell.

Because of you I have a reason to smile every day.

You are the reason why I sing.

You are the reason why I love again.

You are the reason why I can't be with you.

Because you are you... my precious.

And you deserve better.
