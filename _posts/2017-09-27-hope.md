Hope is a poison for me.

But a poison for one doesn't necessarily mean a poison for others.

And I still hope, for you.

&nbsp;

I hope that you're not alone when you cry.

I hope that there's always someone to hug you and tell you that everything's gonna be all right.

I hope that someone will keep your heart safe and value it like the greatest treasure they ever have.

I hope that someone will love you more than they love themselves.

I hope that you will never know how it feels like to be me.

&nbsp;
