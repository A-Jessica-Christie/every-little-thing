You make me crave for you...

&nbsp;

I want to taste your smile.

I want to feel the warmth of your hug.

I want to get drunk on your love.

I want to hear your voice, your laughter.

I want to see you sing.

I want to be crazy with you.

I want to lose myself in you.

I want you, and you alone.

&nbsp;

Will I ever get the privilege?

Will I ever get the right?

Will I ever get the chance?

&nbsp;
