The thing about fools, is that they don't even realise the fact that they are the fools, and they often think that they are the brightest of the people around them.

With their conceited nature, the fools value their ego on top of everything in their life. So when someone tries to critize them or give them advice, they will only get mad at the person because that said person hurt their ego. Almost like stepping on a dog's tail - the dog will bark and try to bite you. Step on their ego and they will yell their lungs at you with their shallow opinions.

And because of the lack use of their brain, they'd only blame others for their failure in life, with no intention of being a better person themselves whatsoever.
