She is a hopeless romantic who would rather watch a horror flick instead of cheesy sappy romance movies.

She is a hopelss romantic who finds the time to read Dracula but too lazy to read Shakespeare's.

She is a hopeless romantic who is afraid of believing too much in true love.

She is a hopeless romantic who flatters better than some men ever could.

She is a hopeless romantic who overthinks at night and falls asleep feeling helpless.

She is a hopeless romantic who loves to be alone.

She is a hopeless romantic who is too damn realistic.

She is a hopeless romantic who thinks that needing someone is a weakness.

She is a hopeless romantic who is scared of falling too deep.

She is a hopeless romantic who despises her dreamy self.

She is a hopeless romantic who thinks that her heart is stupid.

She is a hopeless romantic who solves problems with logic rather than intuition.

She is a hopeless romantic who feels that she's better off on her own.

She is a hopeless romantic who clenches her jaws when hearing someone says I love you.

She is a hopeless romantic who would rather feel nothing than getting hurt.

She is a hopeless romantic who thinks that romance is overrated.
