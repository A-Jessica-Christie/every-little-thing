##### Legend said…

On the coldest winter night, a terrifying monster would come to haunt ever soul who was still awake.

With its crimson eyes and bloody face, your vision would become blurry and foggy, and your head would start to ache ― a piercing pain inside your skull.

Then you would scream, but there would be no sound.

The harder you scream, the louder the silence.

&nbsp;

##### Legend said…

If you want it to stop, you got to sleep.

But how could someone sleep when they were in so much pain?

So you would have to bear it ― an endless sufferings.

Until you lost yourself into oblivion, or until the first ray of sunshine came down, to chase the monster into the darkness, where it belonged.
