When you’ve been walking in the dark for way too long,

and suddenly you see a light at the end of the tunnel -

you finally smile for the first time in forever…

But the more you walk, the more the light goes further away,

almost as if it’s trying to get away from you - like it’s saying,

> “There’s still hope… but it’s not for you.”
