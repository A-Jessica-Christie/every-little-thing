##### Being a hopeless romantic...

How do you survive living in a world full of no string attached relationships?

How do you survive living in a world where most people think that feelings and emotions are overrated?

How do you survive living in a world where people constantly mock you for your beliefs?

How do you survive living in a world where love and attention could be bought with money and pretty face?

How do you survive living in a world of plastic?

How do you survive living in a world where the people only see things in black and white?

How do you survive living in a world filled with vultures and thieves at your back?

How do you survive living in a world where most of the people just couldn't care less?
