{% include preloader.html %}

The best feeling in the world, is when people have blind faith in you.

That no matter what you did ― all the wrongness and the bad things ― they still believe that you are good, to the core.

I can't thank you enough for staying and believing in me even when the people who should've been there for me didn't.

You guys are the real family.

I love you all!
