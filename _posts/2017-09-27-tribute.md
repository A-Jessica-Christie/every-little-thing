The best feeling inn the world, is when people have blind faith in you.

That no matter what you did - all the wrongness and the bad things - they still believe that you are good, to the core.

I can't thank you enough for staying and believing in me even when the people who should've been there for me didn't. You guys are the real family.

Love y'all!
