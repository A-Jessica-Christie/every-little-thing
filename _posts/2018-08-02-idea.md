Just because you can't feel it, doesn't mean that it's not real.

Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean that it's not there.

Just because you can't hear it, doesn't mean that it's not exist.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Don't ditch an idea just because you don't understand it, or you think it's ridiculous.

There may be a reason, or even a story behind it.
