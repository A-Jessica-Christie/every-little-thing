Living in my own head, can’t escape this prison

Fighting my own demons, losing the battle of will

Hanging by a thread, never ending torment

&nbsp;

Don’t try to save me, ‘cause I don’t even want you to

You’d get lost in here, just like I did

Just leave me be, ‘cause I’m better off on my own

&nbsp;
