When it's the only memory I have...

When it's the only thing I have...

&nbsp;

How am I supposed to replace it?

How could I?

How am I supposed to do that?

&nbsp;

I can't...

&nbsp;

If I do it, I'll lose everything.

There'll be nothing left anymore.

And I doubt there will be more.

Even though I wish there will be.

But hoping for something is really tiring.

Especially when you know it's not going to happen.

This wishful thinking only got me nowhere.

Walked out from hell, only to walk into another one.
