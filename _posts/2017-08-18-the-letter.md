##### Dear borther...

If I could turn back time, I would go back to the time when you begged me to lend you my stupid laptop and I chose not to, because I chose my friends over you ― friends whom I no longer in contact with, who probably are out of my life for good. I was an idiot ― arguably still am ― and I shouldn't have broken your heart and trust..

&nbsp;

##### Dear sister...

If I could turn back time, I would go back to the time when I should have said "sorry" to you even if we both know it wasn't my fault at all, because it was the only thing you wanted to hear me say, but my ego was too damn huge and it got in the way of the both of us..

##### Dearest brother...

I miss the time when our parent kidnapped us to go somewhere with them but left us stranded in the car for hours, listening to the radio and switching channels, laughing our lungs out with our stupid jokes at each other..

&nbsp;

##### Dearest sister...
I miss the time when we both could share stupid details about our life freely and teasing each other with our inside jokes, getting mad at each other but always ended up doing things together ― our Sunday Movie sessions..


&nbsp;

##### My dear brother and sister...

I really am sorry I'm such a coward, that I couldn't even say these things to you both in person ― only writing this stupid post that both of you would probably never read. But if somehow you do, please know this for sure, that you two are always in my prayers, always in my heart, no matter what happened, no matter how drifted apart we all are now.

I love you both. Always and forever...
