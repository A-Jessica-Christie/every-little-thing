Give me some time to mourn for your smile

The smile of sunshine that you think is worthless

The smile you had forgotten to use

Behind that smiley mask of yours

Give me some time to mourn upon it

To bid my last farewell to the smile I adore

&nbsp;

Give me some time to mourn for your heart

The heart of gold that you think is your weakness

The heart you had buried years ago

For it was bleeding painfully to death

Give me some time to mourn upon it

To bid my last farewell to the heart I love

&nbsp;
