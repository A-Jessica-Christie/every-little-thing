##### Tell me...

What do you know about me?

You only know things that I let you see.

You don't know my struggles. You don't know the demons I'm battling every single day. You don't know the pain I'm suffering. You know nothing about me.

I may say things to you, sharing a little piece of my mind. But don't you dare label me things based on those little puzzles that I left scattered on the floor - the whole picture is so much bigger than your mind to comprehend.

If you don't have the heart to understand it, you don't have the right to judge it. As simple as that.
