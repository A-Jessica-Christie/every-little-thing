##### Tell me...

What do you know about me?

You only know things that I let you see.

You don't know my struggles.

You don't know the demons I have to battle every single day.

You don't know the pain I'm suffering.

You know nothing about me.

&nbsp;

I may say things to you, sharing a little piece of my mind. But don't you dare label me things based on those little puzzles that I left scattered on the floor ― the whole picture is so much bigger than your mind to comprehend.

&nbsp;

If you don't have the heart to understand it, you don't have the right to judge it.

As simple as that.

&nbsp;
