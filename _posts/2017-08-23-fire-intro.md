Why are you bottling up your feelings? Will you stop it?

Please...

It hurts me seeing you like this.

You bottled it up because you think no one will understand.

But I'm here, and I understand.

I can feel your pain, all your sufferings that you never let anyone see, all the cuts that you covered up so perfectly.

Share your pain with me - I'll bear it with you. I'd steal your pain away if I could.

I won't ever let you cry alone.

Ask me to stay, and I'll never leave.

I'm here for you. Always. Even when you don't need me.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Yours forever,

Fire
