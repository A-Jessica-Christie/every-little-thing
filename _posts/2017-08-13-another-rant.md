#### So sick of this world...

So sad that most people don't care about the process. They only care about the end result. And if the end result isn't as they hope it would be, they'd think that it's bad, that's it's not worth it - an abomination.

They don't know the struggle to reach it. That some of us have to sacrifice something, perhaps everything, to finally get to the end result.

We live in a society where people won't survive without judging the next person. Your every move is judged according to their standard of perfection, according to their needs and wants. They don't wanna know the reason why you do it. They only wanna judge it.

Don't you ever get tired?

Everything happens for a reason.

Sometimes my action may seem a little harsh, may seem careless or selfish. But do you know the reason? Do you really know why? Or is it just your assumption? Just another one of your judgements? You don't know me. You don't even know the way my brain work - that my heart has to fight with it every single day, just not to lose myself.

I will not explain myself because you don't even care. So why should I bother? It's just too damn exhausted, having to explain yourself with every breath you take.

Yeah, why should I bother? Even if I explain myself, they still wouldn't believe anything I have to say. For them, it's way too unreal, too good to be true. Fake. It's too much for their heartless mind to accept.

And you're asking me why I'm so sick with this life? Ha!
