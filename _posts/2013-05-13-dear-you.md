I wanna be someone who affects you ―

your world, your emotions, your feelings, your actions, even your way of thinking.

I'll mend your broken heart ― yes, I'll fix it for you!

I'll fight all of your fears, even the darkest ones.

I'll wipe the tears on your face.

I'll always be there for you, even when you don't need me.

and I'll make sure that you are ― and will always be ― loved.

&nbsp;

With all I am,

the Helper.
