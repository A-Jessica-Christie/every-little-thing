The problem with thinkers: they have think too much and always overthink because they’re afraid to make mistakes.

The problem with doers: they rarely think and just do things, no matter if they’re doing countless mistakes.

&nbsp;

Which one do you think is happier?

&nbsp;

Obviously, the doers.

Why?

Because life is about living\!

The thinkers are too afraid of living because they’re too scared to actually do anything.

The proverb “Ignorance is bliss” really is true.

Yes, perhaps the doers did make so many mistakes but if you ask them, they’ll most definitely say, “That’s life, dude\! You make mistakes.”

&nbsp;

Life isn’t fair; and shit happens.

Those idioms apply to everyone, with no exception.

Even if you’ve finally reached a decision by thinking something too much and you hope it would be the best decision, well guess what? You don’t know the future. Anything can happen. There are way too many factors in the world that we just couldn’t think of, no matter how hard we tried. But of course, I wasn’t talking about big decisions relating to life-changing events or works. What I’m talking about here is our every-day life. We’re too afraid to call someone because we’re too scared they’ll think we are too pushy, too clingy, or too desperate. Or maybe we hesitate to tell our loved ones how much they mean to us, because we think it’s not necessary and could only arise another unnecessary situations.

&nbsp;

“Look at those idiots\!”

We call them idiots but actually, deep in our heart, we long to have their freedom, we long to be ignorant, but we just overthink every thing and decided we’re better off like this.

Wake up\! You only live once\!

If you overthink again, just remember this simple fact that no matter what you do, even if you’ve spent weeks thinking about it or not, the outcome will always be unexpectable. It could be anything. It could only be either a good impulse or it could be a really bad mistakes. But, when you analyse it again, it was actually not that bad. Okay, maybe it was bad, but overthinking something won’t guarantee that things would be less bad either. The things with thinkers is that after we did our mistakes, we tend to get too carried away with it, for way longer than we should. Maybe we want to reflect upon it, and it’s totally understandable. But what we don’t realise it that we are blaming ourselves. We have to move on from our mistakes, and we have to forgive ourselves. Yes, you heard me. Forgive yourself\!

&nbsp;

Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Don’t be scared if people reject you. If they do, probably they don’t even deserve to be in our lives at all, or maybe their roles in our story we called life is simply over. But don’t worry. Others will come and some will definitely stay. Listen to your heart for once. Let the brain rest for a bit. Because the people who don’t matter, wouldn’t care, and the people who matter, wouldn’t mind.
