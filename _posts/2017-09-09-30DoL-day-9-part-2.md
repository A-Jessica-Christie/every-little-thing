You have no clue...

of how much I wish I could turn back time.

of how much I wish I could undo my mistakes.

of how much I wish I could justify my wrongness.

&nbsp;

But no...

I won't do any of it.

Even if God showed up in front of me to grant me the chance to turn back time, I still wouldn't do it.

&nbsp;

Why, you asked?

Simple, really.

Because if I turned back time, I wouldn't have met you.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So I'll live this hell...

Even if it's just with the ghost of you.

&nbsp;

## What You Don't Know
