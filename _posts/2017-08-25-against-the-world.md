When you've seen too many lies
When you've endured too much pain
When you've been betrayed too many times
When you've been stabbed in the back by the ones you love

You turned sour
Bitterness is your new name
Misery is your new best friend
And loneliness is your new wardrobe

Don't...
Don't let the world defeat you

Someone will find you one day
Someone that will finally say,
"It's okay...
It's us against the world now."
