{% include preloader.html %}

When you’ve seen too many lies

When you’ve endured too much pain

When you’ve been betrayed too many times

When you’ve been stabbed in the back by the ones you love

&nbsp;

You turned sour

Bitterness is your new name

Misery is your new best friend

and Loneliness is your new wardrobe

&nbsp;

Don’t…

Don’t let the world defeat you

&nbsp;

Someone will find you one day

Someone that will finally say,

“It’s okay…

It’s us against the world now.”

&nbsp;
