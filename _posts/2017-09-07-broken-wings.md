#### If angels have wings, don’t you think God has wings too?

Humans are created in the image of God. So if God has wings, we also have wings - or we used to. Perhaps when God banished Adam and Eve from Eden, he also cut down their wings. That’s why the urge to soar high up to the sky, to be free, is always in our blood - because we used to be able to fly. And now when we don’t have our own wings, we spend our lives trying to build our own. But the wings we build aren’t divine, so it will shatter when we fly too close to the sun.

So I’ll give up my wings for you. I know it’s not much. I know it’s broken and it’s not perfect. But some of the parts are still working, so you can use them to fix your own. It’s all right. I don’t mind. I’ll be happy seeing you fly… It will break again at some point, but you don’t have to worry about anything, because I will be down here, and I will catch you when you fall. Always…

#### I promise.
