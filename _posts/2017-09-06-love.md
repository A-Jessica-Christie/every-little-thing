You see...

Love is funny, weirdest thing.

Most people say they're in love, but they don't even know the meaning of it. They still couldn't grasp the concept of love.

Love isn't always about romance.

Love isn't selfish or needy.

When you love someone, you don't necessarily have to be with them. You don't necessarily have to be their lover. Love is so much more than that.

Love is about giving, not taking, or asking.

Love is about the willingness to make the happiness of your significant other become your number one priority.

Love is about putting the joy and well being of your loved ones before yours.

Love is about making them smile despite the tears on your face.

Love is about making them laugh despite the ache in your heart.

Love is about making their happiness become yours too.

Love is about letting them go and be with someone else if it makes them happier.

Love is about wanting what's best for your loved ones, even if that doesn't include you.

Love is about creating a heaven for them, even though it costs you living in hell.

Love is all about sacrifice.
