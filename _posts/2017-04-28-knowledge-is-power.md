People say that “Knowledge is Power”.

Well, I won’t argue with that, but there are some things that are better left unspoken, some things that are forbidden even to think about - some things that you weren’t supposed to know.. and knowing those things will only give you a burden - a burden so huge that you can’t carry it yourself.

But what can you do?

You certainly can’t tell the others, otherwise you want them to carry the same burden as yourself.

Don’t play with fire, it can definitely hurt you\!

&nbsp;

Curiosity is good, but there are limits.

“Curiosity kills the cat\!” is a black humour that you need to keep in your mind, for actually there is no joke about death - it could kill you\!

Before you wanna know about something, before you wanna learn about any thing, keep in mind about the consequences.

Don’t go blindly into some dark and untouched places, until you know what’s in it for you, or else\!

Your choice…
