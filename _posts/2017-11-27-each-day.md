With each day we live, we're getting closer to our death...

It's not a grim point of view, but a reminder that we only live once and we have to live it fully or we'd ended up in regrets. When things got chaotic and out of your control, you're more than welcome to hop on another bus and go on your own way. It's your life and you're the one who lives it. So make the best and most of it. Enjoy and appreciate everything before it's too late.
