{% include preloader.html %}

Go to sleep and close your eyes

and dream of broken butterflies

that tore their wings against a thorn

you know the pain that they have borne

&nbsp;

Silver metal shines so bright

scarlet blood that feels so right

dream of that blood trickling down

and wake up just before you drown

&nbsp;

The moonlight's shining off your tears

as you bleed out your own worst fear

so tonight when you start to cry

whisper the cutters' lullaby

&nbsp;

You didn't know that life would be this hard

Time to end the pain that you hid so well 

&nbsp;
