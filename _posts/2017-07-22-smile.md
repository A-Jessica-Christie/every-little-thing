##### To all the underdogs, and a certain someone...

I just wanna see you smile, even if it's not because of me

Don't you know how precious your smile is?

Maybe I'm not worthy of your smile, but please smile, for yourself..

&nbsp;

When you wake up in the morning and see your reflection in the mirror,

smile...

Maybe you won't see it at first, but eventually

you'll realised just how beautiful you are

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Hopefully in the end, you'll know how precious you are to me...

&nbsp;
