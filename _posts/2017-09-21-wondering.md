Wondering what will happen if you know the truth...

Will it hurt you?

Will it make you devastated?

Will it make you lose your faith in people?

Will it make you hate me?

&nbsp;

Some things are better left unspoken...

&nbsp;

One thing for sure,

that when I'm finally telling you the truth,

I'm stabbing myself over and over with every word I speak...

The truth may kill you, but it kills me first.

&nbsp;
