Please tell me...

How could someone be happy if he's surrounded with people who couldn't accept him for who he is?

How could someone be happy if the people who were supposed to love him, treated him like a wild card? - the black sheep of the family.

How could someone be happy if the people he was stuck with, forced him to be a smiling robot?

How could someone be happy if he couldn't be himself?

How could someone be happy if he had to pretend and wear a mask every single day?

How could someone be happy if his passion had been stripeed away from him?
