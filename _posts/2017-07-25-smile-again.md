##### Let me tell you this once again...

When you wake up in the morning and see your reflection in the mirror,

SMILE!

There's always someone out there that still cares for you

and is aching to see you smile again

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Oh what I wouldn't give to put a smile on your face...

&nbsp;
