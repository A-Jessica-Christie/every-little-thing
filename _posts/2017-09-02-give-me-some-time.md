Give me some time to mourn for your smile
The smile of sunshine that you think is worthless
The smile you had forgotten to use
Behind that smiley mask of yours
Give me some time to mourn upon it
To bid my last farewell to the smile I adore

Give me some time to mourn for your heart
The heart of gold that you think is your weakness
The heart you had buried years ago
For it was bleeding to death
Give me some time to mourn upon it
To bid my last farewell to the heart I love
