The most valuable gift you could ever give to someone, is your time.

Because you couldn't turn back time. You could only spend it.

If you don't even have time for your loved ones, it simply means that you don't love them enough, or that they're not dear enough for you.

But if you already give your time for them and they took it for granted, it simply means that they're not worthy of your time.
