Don't cry for the dead..

But smile for them instead..

&nbsp;

Smile, because they could finally be free.

Smile, because they're finally at a better place.

Smile, because they're finally in peace.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Deep condolences to all of you who have lost someone.

Stay strong.

&nbsp;
