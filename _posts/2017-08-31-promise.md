I can’t promise you a day without trouble

I can’t promise you a week without conflict

I can’t promise you a month without heartache

I can’t promise you a season without misery

I can’t promise you a year without sorrow

I can’t promise you a life full of happiness and laughter

I can’t promise you days full of sunshine and roses

I can’t promise you anything

but this…

I will always be there for you whenever you need me

and that…

You will always have a special place in my heart

&nbsp;
