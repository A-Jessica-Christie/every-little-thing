People say we’re too much ― that we’re overreacting and exaggerating things, just because they don’t feel the way we feel.

They don’t know what we’re feeling. They can’t understand it ― because they’re not built that way.

It’s like someone with blue eyes ― they were born like that.

Did they specifically ask to be born with blue eyes? Or green, or brown?

Nope. No special request accepted.

&nbsp;

Like it or not, we were born this way.

&nbsp;

They can either choose to accept us the way we are, or be in denial and reject us and bring us down every single time we try to express our feelings.

But what they don’t know is that, those emotions are real ― too real. And yes, those emotions are too much ― even for us.

Every time those emotions come crashing down upon us ― like a tidal wave ― we’re suffocating, drowning.

How could you fight an act of nature? It’s unavoidable. And the worst part is, those waves come striking when we’re vulnerable, when our guards are down.

&nbsp;

Some of us learn to swim, trying so hard to survive.

But there are others who are too tired of it and just simply surrender ― giving up.

Ignorance is bliss, yes, but what we don’t know is that even if we choose to not acknowledge those waves of emotions, we are still drowning ― down and down we go, into a bottomless ocean…

So I’m gonna ask you a question.

Just because you can’t feel what others are feeling, does it mean that their feelings aren’t significant?

Does it mean that their feelings are less important than yours?

&nbsp;

What if we change the role, and I tell you that you’re just a heartless bastard ― that you could feel nothing. It’s wrong, right? You may seem heartless, but you have feelings too.

Stop labeling people with stuff that you can’t even understand. It’s showing us how “mature” you guys really are.

&nbsp;

If you want respect, you have to respect others first.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Never forget the golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you…
