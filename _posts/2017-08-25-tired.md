I’m tired of people and their expectations

I’m tired of the society and their standard of perfection

I’m tired of being helpless and miserable

I’m tired of living hopelessly

&nbsp;

Didn’t I have enough already?

&nbsp;

I don’t want the world to change me into somethin I’m not

I don’t want the world to turn me into a bitter person ―

a more bitter person than I already am

I don’t want the world to force me to be someone I hate the most

&nbsp;

Please don’t let them…

&nbsp;

I wanna be the old me

I miss myself

I wanna be that someone you used to call Angel

&nbsp;

Let me be your Angel again…

&nbsp;
