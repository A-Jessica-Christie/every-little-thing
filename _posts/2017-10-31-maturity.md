Maturity is when you see someone makes a mistake and instead of blaming him/her and pointing out their mistakes to the world, you try to understand why they're doing it, and perhaps try to get them back on the right track - if possible.

Maturity is also knowing when it's time to walk out and leave, when you have done everything in your power to get them to the right track but they still won't budge. It is knowing when you're no longer needed, and letting go, with no hard feelings.
