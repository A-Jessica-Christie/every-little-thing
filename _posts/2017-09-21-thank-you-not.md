You...

You teach me to enjoy the company of myself

You teach me how to ignore my surroundings

You teach me to hate myself more and more each day

You teach me to fake a smile every day

You teach me how to be a hypocrite

You teach me to pretend that nothing's wrong

You teach me how to live like a zombie

You teach me to cry without making a sound

You teach me to swallow my pain

You teach me to envy others

You teach me to clench my jaws harder every day

You teach me to be cold and heartless

You teach me to hate my life

You teach me to destroy myself

&nbsp;

You make me think that God has abandoned me

You make me feel like I'm living in hell

You make me lose my passion

You make me the bitterest person I ever knew

You make me crave my me time all the time

You make me lose my faith in people

You make me lose my willingness to go on

You make me become the person I despised the most

You make me so pathetic

You make me hate myself

You make me lose myself

You make me sick of living

You make me scared of the future

You make me think that death is the only escape

Thank you oh so very much...

&nbsp;
