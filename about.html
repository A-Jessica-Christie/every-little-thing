            <h3> Dearest Reader... </h3>
            <p> Thank you for taking the time to read this little note. I'll just make this quick. <br> <br>
                First of all, I want to apologise in advance if most of my posts are way too dark and gloomy - it was a really difficult time for me. <br>
                Also, I haven't been writing again for quite some time, so you may say that these posts are rather ancient. <br> <br>
                You might also notice the many variations of fonts and layouts, and I apologise again if some of you might find it a little inconvenient. <br>
                I just want you to really feel and understand all of those writings, and to have a full experience in reading them. For best experience, you can try to read them on laptop/PC. <br> <br>
                Lastly, just let me know if you have any stories/posts that you want to share and I'll gladly feature them here. <br> <br>
                Cheers! </p>
            <br>
